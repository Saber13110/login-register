# login-register

This repository contains a simple Angular frontend with login and register pages.

The frontend code is located in the `frontend/` directory. It provides two Angular components:

- `LoginComponent` for user authentication
- `RegisterComponent` for account creation

A backend can be implemented with FastAPI and PostgreSQL (not included in this repository).

To run the Angular application locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install   # requires internet access
npm start
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:4200/`.
